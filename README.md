# ImperialBeachGroundwater
Imperial Beach, California, groundwater data collected and processed at 4 sites: S Seacoast Drive, 5th &amp; Grove, IB Public Works, and 11th &amp; Ebony. This groundwater table elevation data has been processed, analyzed, and used to create an empirical groundwater table model. The model was used to create groundwater projections out to 2100. This GitHub repository contains the Python code for data processing, analysis, and model creation/use. Austin Barnes assumes all responsibility for code errors.
